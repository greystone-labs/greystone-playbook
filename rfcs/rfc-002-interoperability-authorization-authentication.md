# Interoperability, Authorization, and Authentication

## Summary

Standard for internal applications to communicate with each other for a seemless user experience and security as a top priority

## Problem

Greystone applicates are fragmented between different user bases and different technologies. There needs to be a consistent set of standards that we can share access between different platforms. Including user Onboarding, Servicing, and processing (LoanTracker).
