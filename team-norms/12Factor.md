# Containerization

Productionization requirements dictate that services MUST be containerized prior to release and SHOULD be a part of the development lifecycle

Benefits of containerization, include 
* Parity between test/development/staging/production
* Consistent deployments (rolling) and horizontal scaling
* Agility
* Portability (multi-cloud, multi-service)
* 1-click development enviroment that mirrors production
* Continuous Deployment and Testing ensures code promoted includes libs, changes, etc.
